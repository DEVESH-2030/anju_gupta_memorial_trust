		Kamal Meattle is an Indian environmental activist and CEO of Paharpur Business Centre & Software Technology Incubator Park based in New Delhi, India. Meattle held a talk at TED 2009 entitled How to Grow Your Own Fresh Air. He has now  authored a book entitled ‘ How to Grow Fresh Air.’
		</p>
		<p>			  
		After becoming allergic to New Delhi's polluted air in 1992, Meattle discovered that three common houseplants could help reduce the pollutants in the air making him a workplace-wellness pioneer.
		</p>
		<p>			  
		Like most innovations, the PBC emerged from necessity. In the mid-1990s, Meattle was advised by his doctors to leave Delhi when he became allergic to the city’s toxic air. Through a mix of trial and error, he arrived at a formula by which a curated selection of house plants helped to improve indoor air quality (IAQ). Meattle reels off figures from a three-year study, conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) with the help of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata—and published in September 2008: 34% fewer respiratory ailments, 12% fewer headaches, 52% fewer cases of eye irritation, and 9% fewer cases of asthma.

		Graduating “Summa-cum-laude” from the prestigious Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in San Francisco, Payal has seen her vision through, leading the wave of home grown famed designers. Seamlessly blending Indian recherché and craftsmanship with modern day western silhouettes, Payal Jain’s name is synonymous with eternal style. She describes her brand ethos as having ‘A western body with an Indian soul’.
		</p>

		<p>
		Influenced by the arts at a young age (Jain’s mother is a musician and father, a design engineer), her world is coloured by the creative realms including dance, music and fine arts. An artist herself, with her evocative paintings, she conforms to the school which believes that fashion is an art form. It is with these values that have been incorporated in Payal’s unique vision, as collections are Pret-a-porter or Haute couture for the modern eclectic woman. Jain is one of the few designers that takes painstaking care of each phase of her design realization. She believes each garment is a resplendent journey, telling a unique story.		  
		</p>

		<p>
		Along with couture, her work has delivered aesthetic solutions across different strata’s of the corporate world, be it Hotels, Hospitals, Airports or Corporations. She has done several fashion shows over the years, to collect funds for NGOs that are working sincerely towards improving lives of weaker sections of society. Consciously and ethically, she contributes to the weaver and artisan communities in remote parts of the country that are an intrinsic part of each collection. She has also written a book on Fashion Science for XI standard under the CBSC curriculum, which is being prescribed by several schools across the country for Fashion design students.
